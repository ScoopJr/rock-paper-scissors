- the playerSelection and computerSelection

Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive 
(so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation). */

/* 6. Write a NEW function called game(). 
Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game 
that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end. 

- Remember loops? This is a great opportunity to use one to play those five rounds:
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      // your code here!
    } 

- At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
- Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.
- Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. 
  Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.
- Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.*/
